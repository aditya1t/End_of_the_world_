# End_of_the_world_
This project took me a while. It was so much fun.  We have a forest section, a platforming section, and a cave which is a work in progress. The master scene is Title.tscn  There is a cutscene before the game starts, so enjoy.  THANK YOU  This is a story of a ghost with no memories of who it was. It is trying to find salvation from this unending cylcle of day and night. Every night it's world begins and Every morning it ends!
